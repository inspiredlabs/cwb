CURRENT TODO LIST:

Add h1 tag(1 pages)
Write the h1 tag so that it closely describes the content of the article, while also including the most relevant keywords associated with the corresponding content.

Add title tag(1 pages)
Missing title negatively impact user experience. Since meta titles are used to name tabs in a browser, they help users to keep track of multiple tabs or windows and navigate efficiently through them.

Add unique description(5 pages)
Try to set up unique description tag for every page. To achieve that rewrite duplicate description tags or close from indexing duplicate pages, or add the same canonical tag to all pages, or redirect duplicate pages to one preferred page.

Add canonical tag(5 pages)
These pages have no canonical tags. So there is a risk of rankings drop due to appearing duplicate content in Google. Choose preferred version of URL and add canonical tag with this value.

Add Open Graph tags(5 pages)
Open Graph formatting allows to display your social media content in an attractive manner. This allows for generating more traffic from social media, as well as making your posts look more professional.

Add Twitter card(5 pages)
By generating attractive tweets, you can increase your traffic from this social media and make your tweets more professional and attractive.


Check if these URLs should be nofollowed in robots meta tag(4 pages)
These pages have 'nofollow' directive in the robots meta tag. This guideline tells a search engine that you want to put less weight to the links at the current page and grant them no internal weight.

Check if these pages should have internal nofollow backlinks(2 pages)
Nofollow attribute means that indexing signals such as link equity (e.g. Google's PageRank) are not passed through the link to the linked URL.

Make title tag shorter(1 pages)
Shorten title to under 65 characters, at least on the most important pages or on pages where important keywords appear past the 70 character limit.


Delete the useless code and large “empty” spaces(1 pages)
Redundant HTML code might slow down the page loading as well as its analysis by search robots.

Check if internal links on these pages should be nofollowed(1 pages)
The presence of internal links with a rel=nofollow attribute recommends a bot to avoid following internal links, thus decreasing their value and weight distribution among website links.

METAdrasi, for two yers now has been covering the educational needs of the children staying in the hotspots of Chios and Lesvos, serving more than 450 children on a daily basis. In Lesvos in particular, METAdrasi operates two Non Formal Education Centers for the children from Kara Tepe and Moria, offering courses of Greek, Mathematics and English, as well as activities aimed at developing and cultivating their cognitive and social skills.

For the needs of the educational program in Mytilene, METAdrasi transports daily more than 250 children outside Moria. These children manage to“escape” for some hours from the terrible conditions of the hotspot in order to participate in the lessons held in the specially designed areas of the Non Formal Education Center in Mytilene, while in Kara Tepe, about 200 students spend creative time daily, both in the lessons and in the Child Friendly Space.

In this context, [Clowns Without Borders](https://www.clownswithoutborders.org.uk/) visited METAdrasi’s Non-Formal Education Center in Mytilene and the Child Friendly Space in Kara Tepe with the aim of bringing joy and laughter to the children.

Both children and teenagers had fun with the three shows that the clowns gave. As one of our educators stated “We were so happy to see how much fun our students had. We believe that such activities fill children with optimist and give them the chance to escape even for a little while, the inhuman living conditions of the hotspots.”

We warmly thank Clowns Without Borders, who, through laughter, passed the message of hope to refugee children!

METAdrasi:
METAdrasi is a Greek NGO founded in December 2009 which helps facilitate the reception and integration of refugees and immigrants in Greece. It is focused on services not covered by the Public Authorities or other NGOs in Greece.

_METAdrasi’s educational activities for refugee children are implemented in Lesvos and Chios with the support of [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/)._

Make Wash Fun (COVID 19)

CWB delivered remote training to Hygiene Promotion
(HP) Officers from Solidartiés International (SI)

working with Rohingya refugees and host communities in Teknaf- Bangladesh. The training sessions
were conducted via Zoom. In the same week, the SI
trainees would then test with the target groups,
give feedback, and train their SI colleagues and

Rohingya community volunteers. Following completion of the training, SI then continued their own

training and measuring of sessions in the field. The

project was very successful both as a demonstration of the viability of remote training as well as

demonstrating the relevance and usefulness of the

CWB approach to Hygiene Promotion in this current covid-19 context. Since completing the training, SI staff have delivered CWB-style hygiene promotion sessions directly to almost 10,000 children.

<!-- CWBi 18 Annual Report -->



CWB UK and CUG Sweden collaborated in Bangladesh for a tour of 9 shows, all of which incorporated a basic hygiene message. This message
became the theme of the show, as well as of various acts within the performance. The artists
also developed a simple theme song for the
show.
The shows were very successful and once again,
the reaction from children, adults and staff was
extremely positive. The team also completed
two Train the Trainers workshops sessions of
three days each, sharing their child-centered,
playful activities with NGOs that work with children.

SUMMARY
Described as “detention centers” by the UN High Commissioner, refugee children and their families live in containers in small locked compounds in Hungary’s Transit Zones. It is extremely difficult to access these sites and there are no dedicated or regular activities for children. The monotony of day-to-day life is compounded in the Summer months when no school takes places. We shared laughter and play through performances and workshops on each site. Alongside this, we created a clown-based resource to share with NGO workers to help build anticipation of the clowns’ arrival and support the running of activities after we had left. We delivered a full days playfulness workshop to 20 UNHCR staff raising awareness about our child-centred approach to work with children.

SUMMARY
In September 2017 a devastating hurricane passed through the island of Saint Maarten.

Hurricane Irma destroyed almost everything causing many people to lose their homes, cars, and jobs, as the local economy lives on tourism and made with which many abandoned their lives there, because it was impossible to continue because of a lack of structure.

The Ukrainian clown Albina Matuzko, a resident of SXM for 7 years, made a worldwide call to the clowns, asking for psychological, affective and emotional support. Clowns Without Borders Brazil responded to this “invitation” and in partnership with Clowns Without Borders USA and UK sent 3 clowns to work with Albina. There were 10 intense days of school presentations, which was the most practical way to reach as many people as possible, since many places were abandoned due to destruction. On the French side of the island, the most destroyed were 3 schools, and on the Dutch side were almost all, missing only 3. In addition, the clowns made interventions in needy neighborhoods, visited homes, and presented to local communities, providing moments in family.

During the stay they had the support of a local Pineapple’s Pete restaurant who provided free food to the 4 staff members, local journalists who photographed and wrote about the actions and impact of the work done!

Improve programme delivery outcomes you already run

Our Programme Delivery Strategy

Programme Delivery to engage children and young people is hard. Especially when the material should assist the recovery of children in disaster. Programme work happens where people are vulnerable to discrimination, overcrowding and health issues.

When NGO encounter hurdles, tight budgets, or changes of plan, training standards slip. This is why we make updating Programme contents as easy as possible.

To improve Programme Delivery already running, we integrate our material as discreet activities. These activities have a monitoring and evaluation component, to help measure impact. Because NGO need help building capacity and, life is complicated enough.

How can NGO Improve Programme Delivery?

NGO can improve programme delivery themselves by:
- reaching a wider audience with current funds.
- encourage direct participation to empower children and young people.
- tailor activities to support behaviour change through facilitator training.
- use age appropriate activities that measure impact.
- Track effective use of aid money using Monitoring and Evaluation.

How can we Improve Programme Delivery together?

To improve outcomes, it's important to be able to get specific. Our depth and range of age appropriate activities can reinvigorate your approach. With facilitator training, it's possible to deliver material reaching the widest audience. Theses programmes gather feedback and measure impact using our Monitoring and Evaluation toolkit.

Working together to reach a wider audience

Our material uses experiences children and young people can repeat again and again.

Working together to empower children and young people

During Programme Delivery, it's important people see someone who looks like them. This helps comfort and engage the audience, which is empowering. Being facilitator lead helps team up with local communities and make material relevant.

Working together to tailor activities to support behaviour change

Our training focuses on facilitators leading activities. This supports behaviour change by encouraging participants to overcome challenges in real time. And we use frameworks that adapt to types of learning.

The depth and range of these activities work elsewhere, with minimal training. Together, these enable your team to improve programme delivery already running.

Working together to use age appropriate activities

We enable NGO to have access to a depth and range of activities difficult to find elsewhere. These have high success rates because they integrate popular frameworks and measure impact. These popular frameworks include Kolb's Learning Cycle, The Kirkpatrick Model and on-going assessment.

We transform technical information into age appropriate activities
tailored to encourage facilitator participation.


-----------------------------------------------

How do you measure impact?

Partner Monitoring Programme

We work with NGO to measure impact of Programme material using quantitative feedback. The goal is improve accountability and measure effectiveness over the long-term.

Our Theory of Change experts understand monitoring and evaluation to assist accountability. These inform our Partner relationships, overcoming challenges normally associated with measuring impact.

About our training structure

Our training structure integrates popular frameworks that support monitoring and evaluation.

Our training structure includes:
- Kolb's Learning Cycle, to identify discreet learning steps and different learner styles.
- The Kirkpatrick Model, to measure the training effectiveness.
- on-going assessment, aimed at long-term progress working with children and young people.

Working together to reach a wider audience

To reach a wider audience you involve children and young people?
- create experiences for children and young people to repeat again and again

Working together to empower children and young people

It is important people see someone who looks like them on stage. It helps to comfort and engage the audience, which is empowering. We help NGO team up with locals that can make material as relevant as possible.



Working together to support behaviour change

Our training sessions support behaviour change through active participation of age appropriate activities.

Between instruction sessions, participants lead activities they are learning to deliver. This means, they experience immediate feedback about what they are learning.
These, age appropriate activities present challenges for them to overcome, without excessive theory.

Experience, results in understanding















Changing the landscape of how we treat children

Play is only part of our work. We make effective use of aid money by training to improve programmes already running. We track our results to prove success, and focus everyone on long-term impact.

Working with children and young people in psychosocial context.

Our success record is due to understanding of how to apply popular frameworks. We use: Kirkpatrick's Model, Kolb's Learning Cycle and on-going assessment. Although we aren't limited to these and integrate with partner systems as appropriate.

## Programme Delivery, Monitoring and Evaluation



### We have an expert Monitoring & Evaluation to assist in Programme Delivery.



### What is Learning?

Learning, is the process of knowledge or behaviour change through experience.

Theory is abstract, so our sessions apply real life situations, immediately.

### What is Kolb's Learning Cycle?
Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, Kolb's Learning Cycle

Whenever people learn, there are always four stages of learning people step through.

These steps are:
- feeling the experience itself (concrete experience, `CE`).
- reflection of the experience afterwards (reflective observation, `RO`).
- thinking of different ways to do things (abstract conceptualisation, `AC`).
- doing experiments from these ideas (active experimentation, `AE`).


Kolb's Learning Cycle gives these technical names, giving us an idea of how they interact. Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualisation and Active Experimentation.



Feel, Think, Watch, Do
CE, RO, AC, AE

Why it's useful?
The steps address every different learner's style:
- watching versus doing
- Feeling versus thinking

These steps combined produce four types of learning style:
- watching and feeling, for flexible idea generators that like groups.
- watching and thinking, for analytical people into ideas, models and concepts.
- doing and thinking, for adaptable practical problem solvers.
- feeling and doing, for intuitive, hands-on types.

effective application of types creates an environment for kinds of people to learn.

## Programme Delivery

Our programmes focus on the long-term impact working with children and young people. `Train-the-Trainer` x in three key sections:
- Girl's Rights. To strengthen self-esteem, agency and inclusion to live free from violence and discrimination.
- WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene). Transforming Hygiene Promotion to make disease mitigation safety messaging go viral.
- Emotional Wellbeing of Children in Disaster. An opportunity to play becomes a vital tool in the protection from toxic stress.

The importance of Play

Changing the landscape of how we treat children

Play is the single most effective way to support learning. Doing so, Clowns Without Borders reach more children and young people than other NGOs.

Following a stable environment, play offers the best psychological protection from disaster.

## How we involve children and young people

### Working together to support behaviour change

Our training sessions support behaviour change through active participation of age appropriate activities.

Theory is abstract, so our sessions apply real life situations, immediately.
