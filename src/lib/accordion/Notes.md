How to sell now and in the future:
- purpose-driven: what we believe in?
- precise: which of my buyers are really real?!
- personalised: clients expect you to know a lot about them... and deliver exactly what they're looking for.
- productivity: only 25% is spent selling: automate data-entry eg.
- profit: help clients act like better Chief Operating Officers (COO). How do we scale growth most efficiently? How do we grow revenue even more profitably?
