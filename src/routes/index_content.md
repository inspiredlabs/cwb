## Our Mission

Supporting the emotional wellbeing of children living through disaster by sharing laughter and play

* * *

<!--[/our-approach/](/our-approach/)-->

## Clowns Without Borders

Global conflict affects 1.5 billion people. It has forced 32 million children to flee their homes. Alongside this, natural disasters affect over 200 million people each year. 

In disasters, the challenges of day-to-day life can be overwhelming. Making sure children have the freedom to play and relax is more important than ever. It helps them make sense of the world and provides comfort and respite when it is needed the most. 

That is why we share our playful performances in refugee camps and crisis zones around the world.
