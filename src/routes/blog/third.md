## Our approach acquires special access

The UN High Commissioner described <b>Hungary's Transit Zones</b> as “detention&nbsp;centers”. It is extremely difficult to access these sites, where families live in small, locked&nbsp;compounds. The monotony of day-to-day life is compounded during Summer, when there is no&nbsp;school. The UNHCR granted Clowns Without Borders special access to develop critically needed Psycho-Social First Aid&nbsp;Workshops.

## A completely unique kind of Humanitarian&nbsp;Aid

Our organisation delivers a truely unique form of Aid, we train staff in emergancies, and help children and young people in&nbsp;crisis. In <b>Hungary's Transit Zones</b> the UNHCR&nbsp;required a series of resources to bring relief and build community&nbsp;resilience. These performances and&nbsp;workshops helped the UNHCR with capacity building to deliver Psycho-Social First Aid for themselves. We also developed a series of activities to help the UNHCR&nbsp;team keep sharing the fun after we had&nbsp;left.

> This partnership with UNHCR trained 20 staff in the most effective child-centred approach to working with&nbsp;children. This helps raise awareness with other NGOs of our unique approach to Aid delivery.

**Play** helps children learn about themselves, each other and the world. It strengthens their bodies and their brains. It opens children up to new experiences and provides fertile ground for developing skills. It’s the best and most exciting way to learn.

SUMMARY
Described as “detention centers” by the UN High Commissioner, refugee children and their families live in containers in small locked compounds in Hungary’s Transit Zones. It is extremely difficult to access these sites and there are no dedicated or regular activities for children. The monotony of day-to-day life is compounded in the Summer months when no school takes places. We shared laughter and play through performances and workshops on each site. Alongside this, we created a clown-based resource to share with  of the clowns’ arrival and support the running of activities after we had left. We delivered a full days playfulness workshop to 20 UNHCR staff raising awareness about our child-centred approach to work with children.
