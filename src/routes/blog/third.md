## Our approach acquires special access by UNHCR

The UN High Commissioner described <b>Hungary's Transit Zones</b> as “detention&nbsp;centers”. It is extremely difficult to access these sites, where families live in small, locked&nbsp;compounds. The monotony of day-to-day life is compounded during Summer, when there is no&nbsp;school.

## A true, unique Humanitarian&nbsp;Aid organisation

UNHCR helped raise awareness by promoting our workshops and X

We created fun resources for the UNHCR&nbsp;to build anticipation before delivering performances and&nbsp;workshops. We also developed a series of activities to help the UNHCR&nbsp;team keep sharing x after we had&nbsp;left.

**Play** helps children learn about themselves, each other and the world. It strengthens their bodies and their brains. It opens children up to new experiences and provides fertile ground for developing skills. It’s the best and most exciting way to learn.

SUMMARY
Described as “detention centers” by the UN High Commissioner, refugee children and their families live in containers in small locked compounds in Hungary’s Transit Zones. It is extremely difficult to access these sites and there are no dedicated or regular activities for children. The monotony of day-to-day life is compounded in the Summer months when no school takes places. We shared laughter and play through performances and workshops on each site. Alongside this, we created a clown-based resource to share with  of the clowns’ arrival and support the running of activities after we had left. We delivered a full days playfulness workshop to 20 UNHCR staff raising awareness about our child-centred approach to work with children.
