## Helping OXFAM deliver WASH programming

Annabel Morgan, Nicholas Mamba, Edward Morgan (logistician) and two international <!--CUG-->facilitators helped create a safe, fun and engaging space for children to explore Hygiene resources. The **WASH** programme helped train adults in the community through playful workshops focusing on&nbsp;self-expression.

> The magic ingredient? Play.

<!--
**Play** helps children learn about themselves, each other and the world. It strengthens their bodies and their brains. It opens children up to new experiences and provides fertile ground for developing skills. Itâ€™s the best and most exciting way to learn.

## Outstanding excellence in the charity&nbsp;sector

We are recognised as providing vitally important psycho-social first aid to children as highlighted by [Points of Light](https://www.pointsoflight.gov.uk/clowns-without-borders-uk/), Prime Minister, Theresa May's award for outstanding excellence in the charity&nbsp;sector. This work can not be done alone, as highlight by our partner contributions through **Plan International** and&nbsp;**Oxfam**.

<!-- We make a change and add resilience to communities -->
