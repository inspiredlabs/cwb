## Dhaka: the world’s most heavily populated&nbsp;city

<!--
Escaping persecution in Myanmar, an estimated 700,000 Rohingya people fled to Bangladesh and now live in refugee camps near **Cox’s Bazar,&nbsp;Dhaka**.
-->

Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh. It is the most heavily populated city in the world, with more than 5,000 slums.
These are inhabited by an estimated four million&nbsp;people.

For <!-- families, -->children and young people living in slum areas, life is extremely difficult. Overcrowding and poor sanitation means children are more susceptible to severe illnesses. Raising awareness about the importance of good hygiene – like hand-washing – can support children’s long-term health and&nbsp;wellbeing.

## UNICEF behaviour change programme

[Make WASH fun!](https://www.unicef.org/rosa/stories/rohingya-children-become-hygiene-promotion-ambassadors-during-covid-19-response-coxs-bazar) is a handwashing behaviour change programme aimed at informing children how to overcome the effects of poor&nbsp;sanitation.

## Learning Through Laughter

Developed over three years with Rohingya children in **Cox Bazar**, this joyful programme shares hygiene's critical message, – which **Clowns Without Borders** helped go viral, being shared with thousands of other children in the slums of&nbsp;Dhaka.

<!--
> The magic ingredient? Play.
**Play** helps children learn about themselves, each other and the world. It strengthens their bodies and their brains. It opens children up to new experiences and provides fertile ground for developing skills. It’s the best and most exciting way to learn.
-->

Maksuda Sultana, a Technical Manager for Hygiene Promotion with UNICEF partner CARE talks about our impact:

> We are teaching through real-life scenarios, by playing games and using drama to deliver important lessons on health and hygiene – in a way that children understand. It’s called "learning through laughter". When children enjoy learning, they are far more likely to remember lessons and adopt good hygiene practices.
