## 8m waves cause havoc in the Philippines

**Super-typhoon Haiyan** killed 6,000 people and is believed to be the strongest storm _–&thinsp;ever&thinsp;–_ in recorded&nbsp;history. As the strom made landfall it created $3Bn USD damage, and caused enourmous disruption to&nbsp;communities. But, as soon as it was viable **Clowns Without Borders** began to provide Psychosocial First Aid through&nbsp;**Plan&nbsp;International**.

Philippines
Tyhpoon Haiyan is believed to be the strongest storm ever recorded in history. It made landfall in central Philippines, destroying 500,000 homes, leaving over 6,000 people dead, and displacing over 4 million people.

Anna-Mai, 16, and her family lost everything they owned. They moved in with friends who shared their food and lent them clothes to wear.

With 34 other young people, Anna Mai took part in three days of workshops. The focus was to provide a sense of recovery and hope after the weeks of loss, grief and misery cause by the typhoon. The workshops were a place for people to come together and slowly start to heal.

“I thought it would be a very long time before I laughed again, but I have, and now I feel like I’m back.”
Anna-Mai
