## 8m waves cause havoc in the Philippines

**Super-typhoon Haiyan** killed 6,000 people and is believed to be the strongest storm _–&thinsp;ever&thinsp;–_ in recorded&nbsp;history. As the strom made landfall it created $3Bn USD damage, and caused enourmous disruption to&nbsp;communities. But, as soon as it was viable **Clowns Without Borders** began to provide Psychosocial First Aid through&nbsp;**Plan&nbsp;International**.

## Our work in East Samar, Tacloban &amp; Leyte

In January 2014, a group of **Clowns Without Borders, USA** facilitators led workshops over 6 days bringing Psychosocial First Aid to children and young&nbsp;people. This was made possible through Plan International and partnering with Doctors Without Borders.

The workshops focused on building resilience by learning to share stories and develop coping&nbsp;mechanisms.

## One participant's experience

Anna-Mai, 16 moved in with friends after her family lost everything they owned. Here, they shared food and lent them clothes to&nbsp;wear. After weeks of misery caused by the typhoon the workshops provided an opportunity to come together and begin&nbsp;healing.

> I thought it would be a very long time before I laughed again, but I have. And now I feel like I’m back!

Anna Mai took part in three days of workshops along with 34 other children and young&nbsp;people, who could focus on recovery and&nbsp;hope.

Philippines
Tyhpoon Haiyan is believed to be the strongest storm ever recorded in history. It made landfall in central Philippines, destroying 500,000 homes, leaving over 6,000 people dead, and displacing over 4 million people.

Anna-Mai, 16, and her family lost everything they owned. They moved in with friends who shared their food and lent them clothes to wear.

With 34 other young people, Anna Mai took part in three days of workshops. The focus was to provide a sense of recovery and hope after the weeks of loss, grief and misery cause by the typhoon. The workshops were a place for people to come together and slowly start to heal.

The Philippines
Not long after Typhoon Haiyan made landfall on the Phillippines, so too did the clowns. Volunteers gave free performances and held workshops for those impacted by the super typhoon. Many of the country’s most vulnerable population lost their homes, livelihoods, and loved ones. The typhoon landed on the Phillippines on November 8, 2013, and though it wrecked havoc across southeast Asia, the Phillippines was hit hardest with waves eight meters high crashing down on the island. Its damages total nearly $3 Billion USD and the storm took more than 6,000 lives.
