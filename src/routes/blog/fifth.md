## Refugees seeking asylum need crisis&nbsp;relief

Co-ordinating with **Save The Children**, Clowns Without Borders went on tour to refugee camps and asylum centres across **Serbia** bringing children and young&nbsp;people Psychosocial First&nbsp;Aid.

> Refugees have made their way here from conflict-stricken countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Pakistan.
[&mdash;&nbsp;Jack Haydon, Save The Children](https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/blogs/2017/serbia-child-refugees-at-risk-in-freezing-conditions)

**Save The Children** contacted us to help bring relief to the&nbsp;refugees. Many are stranded in Serbia because applications for Hungarian asylum are granted very slowly –&nbsp;at a rate of only 10&nbsp;a&nbsp;day. This is compunded with the hundreds of&nbsp;thousands of people taking the _Balkans&nbsp;route_ arriving in terrible conditions in Belgrade, the Serbian&nbsp;capital.



## The importance of Play as a Human Right

# Serbia: child refugees at risk in freezing conditions

![children_in_serbia_rs131046_dsc_1099_pixelated](/content/dam/gb/images/blog/2017/01/RS131046_DSC_1099_pixelated_new.png/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.768.768.png)

Three Afghan children, aged nine and ten, shelter from freezing temperatures in an abandoned warehouse in Belgrade.

## Nearly 2,000 refugees, including up to 300 children, are at risk of freezing to death, frostbite and hypothermia.


Trapped in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, children are sleeping in makeshift accommodation, in temperatures lower than -14C as they wait for access into Hungary.

The abandoned buildings where refugees are staying have high ceilings, broken windows, no heating, and no toilet facilities.

### Desperate measures to stay alive


Children are making beds out of newspapers to keep warm, and in an effort to prepare hot meals, people are making uncontrolled fires – the smoke thick black from the plastic used as kindling.

As conditions worsen, the number of refugees attempting to cross the border is climbing.

Up to 61 people have already died as a result of the conditions and some have been waiting for nearly six weeks.

### Families fleeing conflict


Refugees have made their way here from conflict-stricken countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Pakistan.

They’re stranded in Serbia because of the time it takes to hear whether their Hungarian asylum application has been successful.

This determines if they are among the ten people a day granted access to Hungary.

In 2015, Hungary fortified its border with a razor-wire fence.

Now, two years later, its cruel border policies have left hundreds of child refugees to endure freezing temperatures in substandard living conditions.

### The journey to Europe

Serbia is on the ‘Balkans route’, used by hundreds of thousands of refugees entering Europe.

It’s now closed, but thousands still attempt the journey.

![Malak_Serbia_border_rs131022_dsc_1060_new](/content/dam/gb/images/blog/2017/01/RS131022_DSC_1060_new.png/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.768.768.png)

Malak\* arrived in Belgrade, Serbia after travelling with her family for days in freezing temperatures. She was suffering from frostbite by the time Save the Children staff met her and her family in Miksaliste Aid Point in Belgrade.

### Our teams are there


With the help of our supporters, we provide crucial support to refugees in freezing conditions. Our response so far has included:

*   Transportation of refugees – including hundreds of child refugees – to safe spaces
*   Distribution of warm winter clothing to  protect them from the freezing conditions
*   Healthcare support to children in need of treatment for things like frostbite and hypothermia

![An activity used in one of our child-friendly spaces in Belgrade, Serbia.](/content/dam/gb/images/blog/2017/01/RS115461_Serbia_refugee_safespace-300x200.png/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.768.768.png)

Specialist protection staff ask children to describe the journey they’ve been on using creativity.  This helps children and teenagers deal with the traumatic events they’ve seen and been through.

Together with local partners, we are running a drop-in centre an the refugee aid point in Miksaliste, Belgrade.

We provide new arrivals with immediate assistance while they wait to register and find accommodation in official shelters.

We also run mobile outreach teams providing legal counselling, and identifying and referring vulnerable cases.

**Child refugees across Europe and the Middle East urgently need help.**

A big thank you to the players of the People’s Postcode Lottery who have made a very **[generous donation to support our work in Serbia](https://www.postcodelottery.co.uk/about-us/news/helping-young-refugees)**. The donation is going towards the provision of child protection services and safe spaces in Belgrade and Presevo in 2017.

# Displaced Connections
- from: https://photography.sarahhickson.com/project/displaced-connections/

In January 2017 articles appeared in the media about refugees struggling to survive in sub-zero temperatures in Belgrade, Serbia. Around 1,000 young men from Afghanistan and Pakistan were living rough in derelict warehouses behind the grand façade of Belgrade’s central railway station. Conditions were bleak on this stretch of wasteland, overlooked by a half-finished luxury development on the riverfront. With no sanitation, the ground littered with rubble, broken glass, wires, and rusting metal, and only toxic rubbish available to burn for heat and cooking, the dilapidated buildings offered little protection from the bitter Serbian winter.

Occupants of the makeshift camp were evicted in May 2017.

The informal refugee camp in Idomeni, a village in Northern Greece close to the border with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), extended across a vast area of open land around the railway station and the recently erected border fence. Flimsy tents hugged the train tracks and lined the platforms of the deserted railway hangar. The fields flooded when it rained, clogging the camp with thick mud. When FYROM officially closed its border with Greece in March 2016, it was reported that there were up to 14,000 displaced men, women, and children from across the Middle East and Africa stranded in the Idomeni settlement. It was the largest refugee camp in Europe until Greek authorities evacuated it in May 2016.

I travelled to Northern Greece in April 2016 and to Serbia in February 2017 with the arts-led NGO Clowns Without Borders UK, to document their work with children and communities living in crisis. For children in precarious environments, the opportunity to laugh and play is a welcome break from the harsh reality they face each day. It restores their rights simply to be children. For adults too, living in adverse situations, it is a precious thing to witness their sons and daughters smiling and having fun.

#### Displaced Connections was presented by the 12 Star Gallery, Europe House, in London in 2018.

## BALKAN TOUR 2019

**Clown Me In** and **Clowns Without Borders – USA** returned to the **Balkan Route**, performing for migrants in _Bosnia_ and _Herzegovina_, _Serbia_, and _Romania_. Some of the performances were planned for people with official refugee status, residing in camps. Other performances were for migrants and Roma people who live in temporary camps. 

This was the **third tour** along the Balkan route _(previous tours in 2017 and 2018)_. In past years, audience members reported remembering the clowns from 2015 and 2016 tours in **Lesvos**. The Balkan Tour epitomizes the complexity of modern displacement. Many of the migrants on the Balkan route fled Syria in 2014 or 2015. They continue to be displaced and migratory, many of them lacking the rights and privileges afforded by an official nationality.

_Tour duration: February 28, 2019 to March 18, 2019_

Performers: Sabine Choucair, David Lichtenstein, and Dustin J Allen

Read more about the tour on [CWB website](https://clownswithoutborders.org/projects/balkan-tour-2019/)

### PAST TOURS

In spring 2017 Sabine spent 3 weeks in the Balkans with Clay Mazing, of CWB USA, for the project Route2Connect. They trained a group of 16 volunteers in clowning and together performed for refugees all along the Balkan route. Read about her trip in our blog [**here**](https://clownmein.com/2017/06/26/route2connect/).

In 2018, Sabine went back to spread more joy, laughter and love to refugees stranded on the Balkan route. She was joined by **[Bekah Smith](https://www.facebook.com/bekahjuggler/?fref=mentions)** and **[Justin Therrien.](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001339524455&fref=mentions)**
Check back for update on how the trip is going and as ever, keep an eye on [**Sabine’s**](https://www.facebook.com/sabouny?hc_ref=ARSiDm7wK7UXE6hCsrJ3q3H6nQdoL256XkJaBpOnsLnGjCNuTl5gSo-cLu-xokI7dT4&fref=nf)and **[Clown Me In’s](https://www.facebook.com/clownmeinpage/)** facebook pages.

## MYANMAR TOUR

**_Tour Overview:_**

**Clown Me In** along with **Clowns Without Borders** sent a group of clowns to tour a show in **Myanmar**. The project is in collaboration with the _Mine Advisory Group (MAG)_, which works on removing mines and runs programs focused on risk education.

CMI and CWB have previously done shows with MAG in Lebanon in 2014, with performances in 25 villages. In 2018, the team performed for risk education in schools near towns at risk of landmine detonation, as well as for people in Displaced Person Camps. We reached around 9000 persons in 12 shows in different areas around the country.

The project ran between the 1st and 15th of December.

_Read about the project updates and insights here_

[Creating a Clown Show About Landmines by Leah Abel](https://clownswithoutborders.org/update/creating-a-clown-show-about-landmines/)
[Mirrors by Leah Abel](https://clownswithoutborders.org/update/mirrors/)
[PAZyaso: A Clown For Peace by Andres Aguilar](https://clownswithoutborders.org/update/clown-for-peace/)

**_Tour Context:_**

As part of their initiative, MAG is providing risk education to teach people about the ways landmines can be recognized, avoided, and reported. The project will aim to increase knowledge and awareness around the topic/issue in children and people who are residing in IDP camps and affected communities.

The internal conflict in Myanmar has been labeled by some as the longest running civil war in the world.  The conflict has led to a heavy contamination of landmines in several of the areas, such as Kayin, Shan, and Bago, among others. MAG has been working in these areas since 2013.

The Team:  CWB and CMI have worked on over 10 tours together, including a collaboration with MAG in Lebanon in 2014. The performing team includes Leah Abel, Andres Aguilar, and Naomi Shafer. Leah has performed with CWB since 2009, most recently in collaboration with CMI in Lebanon.  She is based in Boston, where she runs Circus Up. Andres has been clowning professionally since 1996, when he joined Ringling Bros’ Greatest Show on Earth. He was has toured with CWB in Kenya and Ecuador.

**Funding:** This project is supported by the **Mine Advisory Group** in partnership with **Clown Me In** and **Clowns Without Borders**.
