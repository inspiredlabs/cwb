# WASH Programme

## Water, Sanitation and Hygine Training

> Water, sanitation, and hygiene<br>are the cornerstone of all aspects of&nbsp;life
[&mdash;&nbsp;UNHCR access to WASH](https://www.unhcr.org/water-sanitation-and-hygiene.html)

The most challenging consequences of crisis, is the lack of hygiene systems. This is often compounded following a Humanitarian Disaster.

This leads to outbreaks of serious disease. Especially in migration situations and dense populations in overcrowded camps.

We have a systematic approach proven to encourage sustainable behaviour change. By transforming technical information into age appropriate activities, we amplify keeping people safe. By framing ideas for children and young people to enjoy, they repeat them again and again.

This means we deliver the WASH Programme more effectively than our partners alone.

<!--Think about this as a spring board to three articles: refugee health, preventing outbreaks in Cox' and another Humanitarian Disaster -->

<!-- We have a `turn key solution` to meet this need:
> We needed a sustainable and systematic approach to help children adopt handwashing as a regular practice.
