# Improve programme delivery outcomes you already run

## Our Programme Delivery Strategy

Programme Delivery to engage children and young people is hard. Especially when the material should assist the recovery of children in disaster. Programme work happens where people are vulnerable to discrimination, overcrowding and health issues.

When NGO encounter hurdles, tight budgets, or changes of plan, training standards slip. This is why we make updating Programme contents as easy as possible.

To improve Programme Delivery already running, we integrate our material as discreet activities. To build capacity and measure impact these have a monitoring and evaluation component. Because life is complicated enough.


## How can NGO Improve Programme Delivery?

To improve programme delivery NGO should be:

- reaching a wider audience with current funds.
- encouraging direct participation to empower children and young people.
- tailoring activities to support behaviour change through facilitator training.
- using age appropriate activities that measure impact.
- using Monitoring and Evaluation to track effective use of aid money.

## How can we Improve Programme Delivery together?

To improve outcomes, it's important to get specific. Our depth and range of age appropriate activities can reinvigorate your approach. With facilitator training, it's possible to deliver material reaching the widest audience. Theses programmes gather feedback and measure impact using our Monitoring and Evaluation toolkit.


### Working together to reach a wider audience

Our material uses experiences children and young people can repeat again and again.

### Working together to empower children and young people

During Programme Delivery, it's important people see someone who looks like them. This helps comfort and engage the audience, which is empowering. Being facilitator lead helps team up with local communities and make material relevant.

### Working together to support behaviour change

<!--to tailor activities -->

Our training focuses on facilitators leading activities. This supports behaviour change by encouraging participants to overcome challenges in real time. And we use frameworks that adapt to types of learning.

The depth and range of these activities work elsewhere, with minimal training. Together, these enable your team to improve programme delivery already running.

### Working together to use age appropriate activities

We enable NGO to have access to a depth and range of activities difficult to find elsewhere. These have high success rates because they integrate popular frameworks and measure impact. These popular frameworks include Kolb's Learning Cycle, The Kirkpatrick Model and on-going assessment.

We transform technical information into age appropriate activities
tailored to encourage facilitator participation.

### Partner Monitoring Programme

We work with NGO to measure impact of Programme material using quantitative feedback. The goal is improve accountability and measure effectiveness over the long-term.

Our [Theory of Change](/about) experts understand monitoring and evaluation to assist accountability. These inform our Partner relationships, overcoming challenges normally associated with measuring impact. Getting specific helps answer the age old question:

> How do you<br>measure impact?
