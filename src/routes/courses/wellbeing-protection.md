# Wellbeing Protection Programme

## Emotional Wellbeing of Children in Disaster


The UN tracks data on [six grave violations](https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/six-grave-violations/) against children during armed conflict. These grave violations contribute to _Toxic&nbsp;Stress_.

The frequency and intensity of disasters is increasing around the world – amplifying suffering. In Humanitarian Crisis there are extreme difficulties and a lack of supporting relationships. These cause Toxic Stress, where children and young people are the most at risk.

More than ever, they need a chance to play.

When we create opportunities to laugh, we ease the impact of trauma and develop coping skills. These moments contribute to a normal childhood and help build community resilience.
