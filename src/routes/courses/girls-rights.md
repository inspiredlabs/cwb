# Girl's Rights Programme

According to the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights), there are 30 Human Rights.

Many women and girls around the world do not have basic Human Rights. They lack the right to live free from violence or discrimination, they can not vote, or even go to school.

Following a Humanitarian Disaster women are especially vulnerable to exclusion and violence. To assist recovery, we use an intuitive approach to reach girls and their communities.

<!-- # Detail About the Girl's Rights Programme -->
We share techniques that establish inclusion, lead to greater agency and strengthen self-esteem. Combined, these help communities become resilient, inclusive and help resolve conflict without violence.
