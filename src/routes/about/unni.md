> Children do not particularly like psychiatrists and&nbsp;doctors…
<br>they are scared of specialists who conjure up images of being poked with&nbsp;needles.
<br>And these are long lasting effects we are talking about. But unless you address those invisible needs, you can’t put people – especially&nbsp;children – back on their feet.
