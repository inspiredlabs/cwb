**Breathing.** We all do it. For most of us, most of the time we're doing it wrong. Unconcious, shallow breathing leads to the body feeling stress more acutely. **Breathing** is the easiest and most instrumental part of the autonomic nervous system to regulate and master. The way you breathe strongly affects the chemical and physiological activities in your body. Consider your breath to be the remote control to your nervous system. Breathing techniques are profound tools to help balance and maintain an optimal state and to awaken the innate and adaptive capacities that regulate your energy under any condition.

**Mindset/Focus** is the golden thread that links the practice together. Breathing techniques and Cold Exposure require patience and dedication in order to be fully mastered. These techniques solidify a foundation of inner confidence and will power to go beyond limiting belief patterns and become strong, happy and healthy.

**Cold** is your warm friend. Exposing your body to the cold creates a cascade of benefits including, the build up of brown adipose tissue and subsequent fat loss, reduced inflammation to facilitate a fortified immune system, balance hormone levels, improved sleep quality, and the production of endorphins – the feel-good chemicals in the brain that naturally elevate your mood.
