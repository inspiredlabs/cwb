# Facilitators

Our Facilitators are anything but clowns. They work in crisis zones, areas of natural disaster,
prisons and hospitals. They are broadly skilled across education, physical theatre, drama, dance, music, circus and comedy. Our Facilitators are highly skilled professional artists.

The common thread that ties them together, is a powerful belief that laughter, joy and play can make the world a more hopeful and peaceful place.

Working in crisis, demands people with high levels of sensitivity and awareness to work effectively. That's why our Facilitators are experts in creating safe, joyful spaces where children and young people feel welcome.

We have a team of 21 Facilitators&hellip; and counting.
