Our Facilitators are highly skilled professional artists.

They work across physical theatre, drama,
dance, music, circus and comedy. They are anything but clowns.
The common thread that ties us all together is a powerful belief that laughter, joy and play can make the world a more hopeful and peaceful place.

​Many of the artists who volunteer with **Clowns Without Borders** also work in crisis zones, areas of natural disaster,
prisons and hospitals.

High levels of sensitivity and awareness are necessary to work effectively in these settings. And that's why our Facilitators are experts in creating safe, joyful spaces where children and young people feel welcome.

We have a team of 21 Facilitators, and counting.
