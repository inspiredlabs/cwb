# Our Facilitators

Our facilitators are highly skilled professional artists.

They work across comedy, clowning, circus, physical theatre, drama,
dance, music and facilitation. The common thread that ties
us all together is a powerful belief that laughter, joy and
play can make the world a more hopeful and peaceful place.

​Many of the artists who volunteer with [Clowns Without
Borders, UK]() also work in crisis zones, areas of natural disaster,
prisons and hospitals. High levels of sensitivity
and awareness are necessary to work effectively in these
settings. And that is why our teams are experts in
creating safe, joyful space where children feel welcome.

We have a team of 21 artists and counting.
