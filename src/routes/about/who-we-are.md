## Who we are

<!--
We are a small team with a big impact. We are meticulous about how we use every donation and make sure every penny works as hard as possible.

### Core Team

The main workload is handled by a Core Team of three people. They support local Facilitators and Volunteers working in multiple timezones to deliver better, more effective Aid.
