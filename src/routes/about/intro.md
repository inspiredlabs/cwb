# About

**Clowns Without Borders** is a Humanitarian Aid organisation working on behalf of children in disaster. We have developed a range of tools assisting the recovery of children and young people in crisis situations.

## Impact

Our website catalogues how **Clowns Without Borders** delivers more effective Humanitarian&nbsp;Aid than our Partners&nbsp;alone.

We operate in over 14 countries, with 21 professional Facilitators, delivering over 30 projects. These focus on Humanitarian Disaster relief, offering respite to over 55,000 participants.

But, our impact goes beyond that&hellip; We understand children are incredibly good communicators, with large networks of their own. This means, we empower each participant with tools to repeat what they have learned.

<!-- Magic. -->

> Whilst we share joy and laughter,<br>our work is making a serious <!-- an enoumous --> differenceâ€¦
 [&mdash;&nbsp;Samantha Holdsworth, CEO.](https://cwb.org.uk/about#who-we-are)

Our simple and effective approach is acknowledged as an important step in _supporting behaviour change_, a key Humanitarian Objective for [Our&nbsp;Partners](/support-us#partners).
