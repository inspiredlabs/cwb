- WASH. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. Transforming safety messaging making  disease mitigation go viral.
- Emotional Wellbeing of Children in Disaster. An opportunity to play becomes a vital tool in the protection of toxic stress.

Play is the single most effective way to support learning. Doing so, Clowns Without Borders reach more children and young people than other NGOs.

We understand play offers children and young people the best protection from disaster.
