<!-- > Help transform the lives of children. -->

### Trusts

Support from Trusts and Foundations can have an incredible impact on lives of children in some of the most challenging places on earth. When you choose to support us, you play an essential role in helping to bring respite, relaxation and joy that so many children deserve.

We are always happy to provide regular updates and attend meetings. We also ensure our reports reflect the impact you have made in a format you prefer.

If youâ€™d like to discuss this further, please [Get&nbsp;In&nbsp;Touch](mailto:sam@clownswithoutborders.org.uk?subject=CWB%20UK%20Trust%20Support).
