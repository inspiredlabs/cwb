### Philanthropy

Philanthropic support from generous individuals can have a huge impact on the lives of children recovering from the impact of war and disaster. A major donation helps to bring respite, relaxation and joy into the lives of children when they need it the&nbsp;most.

Together we will work to ensure we can impact the lives of as many children as&nbsp;possible.

In return you will have the opportunity to meet with the charity’s Directors and Board of Trustees. You will also receive bespoke reports and invitations to see our work in&nbsp;action.

If you’d like to discuss this further, please [Get&nbsp;In&nbsp;Touch](mailto:sam@clownswithoutborders.org.uk).
