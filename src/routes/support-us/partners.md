## Partners

<!--strong>
We are looking for Partners to provide substantial funds to assist Children&nbsp;in&nbsp;Crisis. Your investment can help amplify our hard&nbsp;work.
</strong-->

<strong class="fw6">We need Partners to provide substantial funds for us to&nbsp;continue.</strong>

We work in areas where we can have the biggest impact. We do this by working in partnership with charities and NGOs who share our values. <!--This means we can assess where there is the most unmet need and bring more joy to the most number of children.-->

Each partnership is different and depends on the needs of the communities we serve. <!--What remains the same is that children’s wellbeing is at the heart of every decision we make.--> If you are interested in working with us, please [Get&nbsp;In&nbsp;Touch](mailto:sam@clownswithoutborders.org.uk).

Get in touch directly, or inform us below to develop a Funding Partnership.

<!-- Logos + Avoid repetition -->
<!-- How are these partners distinguished? -->
<!-- Should we write a page about the relationship with each one? -->

Our partnerships include UNICEF, UNHCR, Oxfam, Plan International, Save the Children and Care.
