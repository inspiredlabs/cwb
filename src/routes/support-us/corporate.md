### Corporate Partners

We can’t do this alone. With corporate partners like you – together, we can make a difference to the lives of children living in the most challenging circumstances on&nbsp;earth.

We also know that every company and their needs are different. We will work with you to create a meaningful and mutually beneficial offer. This could be participating in challenge events, sponsorship, payroll giving, Corporate support, _charity of the year_ or cause related&nbsp;marketing.

If you’d like to get involved, please contact <!-- [sam@clownswithoutborders.org.uk](mailto:sam@clownswithoutborders.org.uk) -->
[Get&nbsp;In&nbsp;Touch](mailto:sam@clownswithoutborders.org.uk).
