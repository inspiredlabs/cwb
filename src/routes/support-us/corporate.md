### Corporate Partners

We can’t do this alone. Together with Corporate Partners, we can make a difference to the lives of children living in the most challenging circumstances on&nbsp;earth.

We know every company and their needs are different. We will work with you to create a meaningful and mutually beneficial offer. This could be participating in challenge events, sponsorship, payroll giving, Corporate support, _Charity of the Year_ or cause related&nbsp;marketing.

If you would like to express interest in our work, please <!-- [sam@clownswithoutborders.org.uk](mailto:sam@clownswithoutborders.org.uk) -->
