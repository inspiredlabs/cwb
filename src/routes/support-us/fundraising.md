## Where Your Money Goes

We understand the need for transparency. That's why we track our impact in two specific ways: through [Transparent Numbers](#transparent-numbers), and [Monitoring and Evaluation](/courses#monitoring-and-evaluation).

### Transparent Numbers

Our Funds are mainly spent on:
- Performances to support Psychosocial First Aid
- **Capacity Building** workshops for staff
- Delivering Train-the-Trainer Programmes <!-- across the globe -->

If you are interested in understanding how we account for our funds, please [Get&nbsp;In&nbsp;Touch](mailto:sam@clownswithoutborders.org.uk).

### Monitoring and Evaluation

Our Training and Programme Delivery, has a [Monitoring and Evaluation](/courses#monitoring-and-evaluation) component to measure exactly how well we are doing to _support&nbsp;behaviour&nbsp;change_. <!-- You can learn more about that here: [Monitoring and Evaluation](/courses#monitoring-and-evaluation). -->
