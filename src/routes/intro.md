## Clowns Without Borders is changing the landscape of how we treat children

By using the single most effective way to support learning, Clowns Without Borders can reach more children and young people than any other organisation.

We train teams to do the same — because we believe play offers children and young people the best protection from disaster.

Invest in Clowns Without Borders, and let's carry this practice forward, forever…

### Amplify your NGO's message

We make aid money work as hard as it can. When children participate directly they take ownership of ideas, remember what they have learned and start applying the lessons immediately. Clowns Without Borders' approach achieves unparalleled transmission of ideas, reaching new participants not present – meaning, children in disaster who are recovering can become part of the Humanitarian Aid delivery process.

### Valuable Training & Tracking

For Humanitarian Aid providers, we help improve programme outcomes you are already running. The effectiveness of which is measured using our Monitoring and Evaluation toolkit, and for children in disaster, this training forms a vital part of their recovery. Clowns Without Borders add value to existing programmes by helping tailor them to use our tools with minimal training.

### Humanitarian Aid that can leverage the ripple effect

The psychosocial first aid context is an opportunity to impart valuable life skills. During play, children and young people go on to repeat their experiences again and again, helping their recovery. This means, Clowns Without Borders can help your message go viral, reaching other children in disaster.

### Capacity Building

Clowns Without Borders create the most relevant, inspiring activities that teach children and young people more effectively. The depth and range of our activities help staff, volunteers and community outreach workers provide better humanitarian aid.
