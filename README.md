# Scope of Work

## Outcomes

This doc is a response to _"Improving digital presence"_, and aims to bring clarity to _"agreed outcomes"_, through clear deliverables.

The project has a _"fundraising-focus"_ contained within a: _"website platform/infrastructure [...] fit for purpose"_. The goal will be to orient the organisation towards `sustainment` and long-term fundraising.

### Deliverables

- Information Architecture to influence people using consistent terminology.
- Define a niche `target audience`, and their appropriate channels of contact.
- `memes` to communicate effectively about how people experience our work.
- Help `visitors` esp. our `target audience` take action via the website.

### Challenges

Although there are numerous challenges presented in this document, probably the most complex is handling the perception of clowns being counter to NGO's `Charitable Objectives`.

CWB is a serious charity _"changing the landscape of how we treat children"_. By correctly understanding our `key-insight` for our `target audience`, we will implement perception change and lay the foundation of `sustainment`.

If possible we need to _design out_ any fundraising conflict of interest.

Currently our `memes` aren't accessible, although people do know of our impact.

Effective accountability is a challenge. Our `target audience` may not realise the extent our experts helping pro-bono are implementing:

```
- M&E [Monitoring & Evaluation]() Expert:
  - specialist "[Theory of Change]()"
- Our training is informed by:
  - [Kolb's Learning Cycle]()
  - and the [Kirkpatrick Model]()
  - and we assess learning throughout.
- Our focus on participants leading activities supports behaviour change e.g.
  - participants are required to implement activities between sessions.
- We work with our partners to implement monitoring.
- This is the monitoring we ask people in our training to work with: SEE GRAPHIC
```



### Information Architecture

IA is as a tool to produce consistent language and terminology. We use it to structure our information, and create ideas that move people towards the kind of action we want them to take.

#### Top level navigation (w. reps.):

```
- our courses:
  - training for facilitators
  - programme delivery
- about us:
  - regulator recognition
  - social impact recognition
    - uk gov. points of light
    - testimonials
    - awards
  - who we are:
    - core team
    - facilitators
      - programme leaders
      - facilitator trainers
    - our network:
      - trustees
      - partners
    - visitors
- our approach:
  - case studies
- support us:
  - donate directly (stripe)
  - fundraising
  - sign-up (subscribe or telephone)
  - work with us:
    - volunteer
    - as a facilitator (safeguarding)
    - vacancies
  - social/share
```

#### Website Content

##### Perception

<div class="tc f3 b">
<img class="w2 h2 v-mid" src="https://inspiredlabs.co.uk/cwb/cwb.svg" alt="Clowns Without Borders" /> Without Borders
</div>

- Animate:
  - Courses Without Borders
  - Care Without Borders
  - Courage Without Borders

##### Misc/unsorted

- CTA: How can you help? Share your favourite story on social media, donate or if you're an NGO work with us.
- From the `aid pots see our shows...` stories, perhaps we can demo:
  - `Clown in Your Pocket`
  - etc...
- Case Studies from Partners (for input/back-links):
  - 'performances'
  - 'capacity building' for Staff/volunteers/community outreach workers
  - 'train-the-trainer'
- Accountability, how do we measure:
  - local partners
  - remote partners
  - others

### Target Audience

- Define and list exactly who, in the humanitarian setting this website is for. eg:
  - NGO "A":
    - Performances to support psycho-social first aid
    - Capacity building workshops for staff
    - and train-the-trainer programmes
  - NGO "B":
    - Capacity building workshops for staff
  - NGO "C":
      - and train-the-trainer programmes
- then answer:
  - `aid pots see our shows...`, so who and what exactly would help `YOUR IDEAL PERSON` do more on our behalf?
  - What exactly would help `Tanya` do more on our behalf?
  - What exactly would help `Head of UNICEF` do more on our behalf?
- leverage assistance from:
  - What exactly would help `Unni` do more on our behalf?
  - What exactly would help `Shilpa` do more on our behalf?

#### Where are our Target Audience?

- What `functions` do people attend and:
  - how do we maximise fundraising opportunities offline?
  - how have they changed w. Health emergancy?


#### Target Audience's CTA

##### Work with us

- preparation and making contact
- `aid pots see our shows...` so we invite them online to **experience our approach to**:
  - `Performances to support psycho-social first aid`
  - `Capacity Building workshops for staff`
  - `Train-the-Trainer Programmes`
  - then: what funding action do we want them to take, ideally?
    - work with us (see: content).

### Memes

We aim to create evangelists:
- Can we distill noteworthy examples of `aid pots see our shows...`?
  - `capacity building`
  - `train-the-trainer`
  - `performances`
- Develop: `...unlikely they have access to the depth and range of our approach`
- Develop: `...how our approach will reinvigorate their practice`
- Develop:
```
CWB is changing the landscape of how we treat children.
Once someone understands play is actually more effective
in supporting learning, they carry this practice forward forever...
See the paradigm shift we are creating with
UNICEF, OXFAM Case Studies
```
- Develop:
  - MAKE WASH FUN: `When children learn through play, we create a win-win scenario... with WASH, we trained 100's of adult facilitators that then reached 10,000's children, that reach more children!`



### Fundraising Focus

Aim to build a platform where `funding & delivery` scale together.

#### How to _design out_ any fundraising conflict of interest?

The workload responsibility for delivering `sustainment` may have to be shared with `our network`, what can we do to:
- create a more _"outward facing board"_?
- improve interactions with "fundraisers on the board, this is because it represents a conflict of interest. We have discussed this and their priority is to the charity that employs them, then us."
- better actions to help:
  - `David is a fundraising leader`
  - `Ed has been a trusts and institutions fundraiser`.
